# MiniSmartHomeCylon

## Scope
This application is developed as part of the course "Redes y seguridad" for the Computer Science Masters's Degree at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).

## Introduction
The MiniSmartHome application uses Cylon, that is a javascript framework for robotics and IoT. A backend application uses Cylon to connect to an Arduino and control different accessories such as LEDs, a motor or a buzzer, simulating a small house by arranging them together into a handcrafted doll house. A React frontend connects to the backend and allows the user to interact with these appliances.

## Clone
